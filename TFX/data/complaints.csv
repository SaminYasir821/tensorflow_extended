Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,766XX,,Consent provided,Web,2025-04-26,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,13193229

I was set up with NewsRez Mortgage. I originally setup to send in my payment, but switched over to automatically for withdrawal in 2020. The first year after paying my mortgage NewRez faile to pay my property tax on time. This caused an emotional stress and embarrassment of having a Sheriff to place a notice on my front door of being in default of paying my property tax. Then in XXXX NewRez failed to pay my homeowners insurance on time which had XXXX insurance to close my account. I attempt plead with them that it wasnt my fault. NewRez failed to withdraw the money from my escrow account which was on file. NewsRez forced me into some ridiculous insure they were applying on my automatic withdrawal. My mortgage went from under & XXXX {$1900.00} a month to {$3300.00} a month. They havent operated in good faith. It seems they were in cahoots with Louisiana insurance to charge consumers more. I was always in good standing! Im writing now not realizing your agency handles such matters. Im a paying consumer with every intentions of paying for what I expect and not to be railroaded by NewsRez. If the market hadnt changed in rates of wouldve went with another company.

Also, I sent them my tax exemption status in which they failed to apply towards my mortgage for the last few years .. Ive had enough and I need to know what recourse do I have. Thank you as I look forward to hearing from you!

2025-04-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,""" I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding unauthorized accounts that persist on my credit report despite my repeated efforts to have them removed. These accounts are causing significant damage to my financial reputation and overall well-being. It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not.

This was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family!

I demand the late payment to be updated.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

EXPERIAN Never Sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith
pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

This practice violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which mandates a reasonable investigation of disputes. Furthermore, Equifax 's actions may also contravene the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), 12 U.S.C.

5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - ( B ), as highlighted in the CFPB 's recent administrative proceeding ( File No. 2025-CFPB-0002 ) against them for similar violations. I request that the CFPB take action to ensure Equifax complies with federal law and provides consumers with the necessary proof of investigation.

2025-04-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,""" The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for each account listed without my expressed written consent.

I looked at my consumer reports and noticed accounts I never gave anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role and have a responsibility to report consumer information to the best of their ability with maximum possible accuracy like the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly states. I did not provide written consent to report them.

I have enclosed a copy of my police report and FTC identity theft report ( FTC Report Number : XXXX ) to support my identity theft claim.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, when a consumer submits an identity theft report, credit reporting agencies must block any information identified by the consumer as resulting from identity theft within four business days.

The following information on my credit report is the result of identity theft and should be blocked : XXXX XXXX As required by 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, please block this fraudulent information from my credit report immediately. This information should be blocked for one year, at which point I may request an extension of the block. During the block, you may not report any information that contains fraudulent data.

Several times I have contacted the credit bureau to report these fraudulent accounts on my report, and the bureau has not provided a solution to this issue. I am being seriously affected, as this situation prevents me from acquiring a new home for my children. These collections were already eliminated and not verified by other bureaus, so I do not understand why it is being claimed that these accounts are mine.

I have requested contracts from the company reporting these accounts, and for more than 60 days I have not received any response. Please help me by immediately deleting these accounts. I am attaching the FTC report, hoping that you will make a fair and appropriate decision in my case.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,32832,,Consent provided,Web,2025-04-23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,13145711

I was told by bank representatives that the transfer had been completed and that the funds would be delivered by XX/XX/XXXX. When I realized I had not received the funds I contacted synchrony on XX/XX/XXXX and a representative assured me I could receive them by today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). However, as of today, the funds are missing, and no one at the bank has been able to confirm their location. 

Ive made multiple phone calls totaling several hours, and spoken with multiple agents and an account manager named XXXX and another named XXXX ( call on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ). Despite repeated requests, the bank has refused to provide any written confirmation of the transaction statusno transaction ID, no confirmation of processing, and no formal acknowledgment of the investigation. 

I was also told that the bank can not locate the transfer and is researching it, but no one has taken ownership of the case or provided a resolution timeline. When I asked for a written summary, even through secure messaging or mail, I was told it is not possible. 

This lack of transparency and accountability is extremely concerning for a transaction of this size. I am now requesting CFPB intervention to : Determine the location and status of the missing {$45000.00} Require the bank to provide written documentation and a resolution timeline Ensure a supervisor or case manager is assigned to my case I am also considering legal action if this is not resolved promptly.

I never filled out an application with Sheels.

I was bounced around to three separate people on the phone. All asked my for my social security number and other private information. I told them I would not provide that as I did not fill out an application and I never wanted their card. I informed them I had received an approval email, but they refused to look up any account associated with an email address.

Kept pestering me for private information and refusing to verify if there was an account in my name associated with my email address, which clearly there is because I am getting an approval email to my email address. 

Flat out telling me that they can not associate an account with an email address and refusing to do anything without trying to get all my personal information screams of a scam.

2025-04-24,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"First of all, I never received any email or official notification from XXXX regarding an outstanding bill. After switching from XXXX, I proactively called their customer service multiple times requesting a breakdown of the charges and to confirm whether I owed anything. Despite my repeated requests, XXXX never provided the details. 

Unexpectedly, I received a call from AmSher Collections demanding payment and speaking to me in a rude and aggressive manner. While they later offered a reduced settlement amount, I continued requesting a detailed bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX I was also responsible for others on the same XXXX  account. 

As of today, XXXX has still not provided any billing breakdown. 

I called XXXX again on Monday morning, XX/XX/XXXX, exhausted from the back and forth, and considered paying the settlement amount just to protect my credit. I explained that I had been unable to follow up earlier due to a death in the family and travel abroad, and I was even willing to provide proof of this. Instead, I was told that the account had already been reported to credit bureaus, and I would need to pay the full amount to avoid further damage. 

I paid the full amount, yet my credit report and score have already been seriously impacted. XXXX still has not assisted me with the bill breakdown. Every time I contact them, they redirect me to AmSher, and AmSher sends me back to XXXX. The entire process has been frustrating, with poor communication and at times, verbal mistreatment. 

I have attached a photo and bill all they provided me after multiple visits to store and even that doesnt help me with breakdown",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Amsher Collection Services, Inc.",CA,95134,,Consent provided,Web,2025-05-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13160112

Despite previous attempts to resolve these issues, the following accounts which are either the result of identity theft or have remained on my report longer than legally allowed are still being reported.

I have already submitted official police reports filed with both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and I am issued an Identity Protection PIN each year by the IRS due to confirmed, ongoing identity theft. Your agency should already have copies of these reports and supporting documents on file. Despite this, the fraudulent accounts below remain on my credit report.

Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), you are legally required to remove any accounts that are more than seven ( 7 ) years old, regardless of whether they were fraudulent or legitimate. If any of the accounts listed fall into this category, they must also be deleted immediately in accordance with federal law. 

Fraudulent Accounts to Be Removed : XXXXXXXX XXXX Closed : XX/XX/XXXX Last Reported : XX/XX/XXXX Credit Limit : {$800.00} Balance : {$0.00} XXXX XXXX Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Last Reported : XX/XX/XXXX Highest Balance : {$18000.00} Balance : {$0.00} XXXX.

Your failure to take appropriate action to date is unacceptable and may constitute willful noncompliance.

To date, your agency has not provided any satisfactory justification for rejecting this report, nor have you taken the necessary steps to investigate or remove the clearly fraudulent accounts listed below from my credit file. As reiterated in my prior letter, federal lawincluding FCRA Section 605B and Section 617requires you to accept valid identity theft reports from consumers, including those submitted through the Federal Trade Commissions IdentityTheft.gov platform. Nowhere does the law require that such reports originate solely from a law enforcement agency. 

Your continued rejection of my legally sufficient identity theft affidavit is not only unsupported by federal law but also constitutes willful noncompliance with the FCRA. This failure to act in accordance with clearly established legal procedures and CFPB guidance reflects blatant disregard for my rights as a consumer and victim of identity theft. 
Let me be clear : This is your final notice. You are in violation of federal law by continuing to report and verify accounts that were opened fraudulently and which I have already disputed with appropriate documentation. 

If I do not receive confirmation within 15 calendar days that these accounts heve been permanently removed and that my credit file has been updated to reflect the resolution of this matter, I will proceed to : 1.File formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission XXXX FTC ), and my State Attorney General. 

2.Initiate legal action for your violations of FCRA Section 617 and for any damages sustained as a result of your unlawful reporting and failure to investigate.

2025-04-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Full Name : XXXX XXXX Date of Birth : XXXX Last 4 digits of XXXX Agencies Involved : Transunion Creditor or Furnisher Name : XXXX XXXX  Account Number : XXXX Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint pursuant to multiple violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and potential violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) by credit reporting agencies and/or data furnishers. This complaint concerns the reinsertion of an account that was previously deleted from my credit report without the legally required prior written notification. 
Below are the specific legal violations involved : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) : Credit reporting agencies must notify the consumer in writing within five days of reinserting a previously deleted account. I did not receive any such notification, making this reinsertion unlawful.

FCRA 607 ( b ) : Requires credit bureaus to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of information. Allowing a deleted account to reappear without proper validation violates this section.

FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Prohibits furnishers from reporting information they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. Re-reporting a deleted account without new investigation is a breach of this statute.

FDCPA 807 ( 8 ) : Prohibits the use of deceptive or misleading practices in the collection of debts. Reinserting a deleted account may be considered a deceptive act.

FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Grants consumers the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. This account was previously disputed and removed, and its reappearance infringes on my rights. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB : - Thoroughly investigate the reinsertion of this account on my credit report. 
- Require the agencies to provide documented evidence of written notification within the legal timeframe. 
- Permanently delete the reinserted account due to FCRA violations. 
- Apply penalties or sanctions if a pattern of misconduct is found. 
- Provide me with a detailed report of your findings regarding this complaint. 


Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that the rights granted under federal law will be upheld. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",KY,40517,,Consent provided,Web,2025-04-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13074055

I have had exceptional payment history all payments were placed on XXXX. This late payment that is reporting is a result on a systematic error on their end processing my payment. 


This was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family!

I demand the late payment to be updated.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

Never Sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided. 


This is unfair, illegal, fraudulent, and not equitable to me as a consumer!

Despite my efforts to address these issues directly with the agencies, the discrepancies remain unresolved. 
The inaccuracies include : XXXX. Discrepancies on late payments : There are several instances where late payments are incorrectly reported. These errors are affecting my credit score and financial standing. 
XXXX. Incorrect information on original creditors : Some accounts list incorrect information regarding the original creditors, which is misleading and inaccurate.

However, my attempts have not resulted in any meaningful resolution. 
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information in my credit report. Specifically : Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) : This section requires consumer reporting agencies to investigate disputes and correct or delete any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable within 30 days. 
Section 623 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) : This section mandates that furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies must not report information that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. They are also required to correct and update information.

Section 605 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) : This section outlines the types of information that can not be included in consumer reports, such as outdated information.

Section 1666b ( 15 U.S.C. 1666b ) : This section specifies that a creditor may not treat a payment as late unless the periodic statement was mailed or delivered to the consumer at least 21 days before the payment due date.

2025-04-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Consumer Reporting Agencies play a crucial role in gathering and assessing consumer credit information. However, they must exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy. The banking system relies on accurate and fair credit reporting, and when these reporting methods are unfair, it undermines public trust, which is vital for the system 's stability. I never gave my explicit, written consent for these agencies to report my information, which is a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ). This violation has led to an alleged case of identity theft, breaching 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. The accounts in question are not related to any transactions made by me.

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was created to ensure that laws and procedures are in place to protect consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair practices by debt collectors. In this case, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692f, which prohibits debt collectors from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt. Specifically, they can not collect any amounts that arent explicitly authorized by the agreement or allowed by law. Additionally, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692e, which prohibits the use of false, deceptive, or misleading representations in debt collection efforts. This includes using deceptive methods to collect a debt or gather consumer information. Moreover, they are forbidden from contacting consumers at inconvenient times or places, or engaging in behavior that harasses or abuses consumers.

In this case, the company has harassed me by claiming I owe a debt that I do not recognize as my responsibility. They have also contacted me at inconvenient times and places, in violation of the law.

2025-04-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"My account with EQUIFAX EXPERIAN TRANSUNION was never late! I have had exceptional payment history all payments were placed on Autopay. This late payment that is reporting is a result on a systematic error on their end processing my payment.

This was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family!

I demand the late payment to be updated.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

EQUIFAX EXPERIAN TRANSUNION Never Sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

This is unfair, illegal, fraudulent, and not equitable to me as a consumer!

2025-04-05,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Experian has failed to fulfill its legal obligation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information on my credit report, leaving inaccurate or unverifiable accounts unresolved. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has recently filed a lawsuit against Experian, alleging systemic issues such as failing to forward consumer-provided evidence to furnishers, accepting unreliable responses, and failing to adequately notify consumers of dispute outcomes. These failures align with my experience, where Experian has neither corrected nor removed disputed items despite the evidence I provided, causing ongoing harm to my credit standing. I am requesting immediate corrective action to remove or amend the disputed accounts, as Experian 's inaction violates federal law and my rights as a consumer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,VA,235XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2025-04-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12838605

The treadmill was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon delivery, I immediately noticed that the treadmill was defective and/or not functioning properly. I contacted the merchant on XXXX to report the issue and requested either a refund or a cancellation of the purchase. 

Despite my efforts, the merchant did not resolve the issue. I then contacted XXXX on many times email, disputed the product and to dispute the charge and explain the situation. XXXX did not properly address the dispute, and instead, the account was later transferred to a collection agency, TrueAccord ( also listed as TrueCPB ), around XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have attempted to explain the situation to the collection agency, but collection activity has continued. I believe I should not be held responsible for this debt because the product was defective and my dispute was raised promptly after delivery.

The account was opened around XX/XX/XXXX, and last reported on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not open this account. It is currently appearing as a derogatory account on my XXXX  and TransUnion reports.

2025-03-26,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am writing to formally dispute an issue regarding a third party obtaining access to my student loan information and attempting to collect debt without my consent. I have recently become aware that [ NELNET a third party ] has been contacting me about my student loan and attempting to collect on behalf of [ the official loan servicer is The Department of Education, ] without proper authorization. 

I understand that the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and the Privacy Act of 1974 protect my right to privacy concerning my educational and financial records. Under these laws, you are required to maintain confidentiality and are prohibited from releasing my loan information to any third party without my express written consent. The unauthorized disclosure of my loan information is, therefore, a direct violation of these privacy protections. Please provide my ( WET INK SIGNATURE ) written consent that show that I authorize a third party to have my personal information. 

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), a third-party collector must not engage in debt collection practices without having a proper legal basis for doing so. The FDCPA specifically prohibits third-party debt collectors from using false or misleading information, harassing debtors, or attempting to collect debts without proper documentation that proves they are legally entitled to collect on a loan. 

Furthermore, I have not given [ third-party NELNET ] written consent to access my loan information or engage in any collection activities on my behalf. Their actions are therefore in violation of the law and represent a breach of my rights as a borrower. Nelnet is a third-party service provider that works with the U.S. Department of Education . ( Nelnet handles a variety of tasks related to federal student loans, including loan servicing, payment processing, and assisting borrowers with managing their student loans. They serve as one of the companies that helps the Department of Education manage federal student loan accounts. ) I demand the following 1. An immediate investigation into how [ NELNET ] was able to access my student loan information and a complete explanation of how this breach of confidentiality occurred. 

2. A halt to any communication from NELNET regarding my student loan, including any debt collection attempts. 
3. Written confirmation that my student loan information will no longer be shared with any third party without my explicit consent. 

4. A formal apology from your office acknowledging the violation of my rights and a statement on how you will prevent future breaches of privacy. 
I request the cancellation of all student loans due to the presence of third-party involvement from Nelnet, which holds information that includes a wet ink signature. The existence of this signature raises concerns regarding the authenticity, accuracy, and legal standing of the loan agreements, potentially invalidating the current terms and conditions. Given these uncertainties, I believe that it is in the best interest of both borrowers and the financial institutions involved to cancel the loans and re-evaluate their legitimacy. This would ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in the loan process, providing relief to borrowers who are currently burdened by potentially flawed agreements.l also I have attached information of them admitting that they are a third party Please confirm that these matters are being addressed within 30 days of the receipt of this letter. Failure to resolve this issue may result in further action, including but not limited to filing a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and taking legal action as necessary. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your timely resolution.",,"Nelnet, Inc.",KY,40511,,Consent provided,Web,2025-03-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12681638

2025-03-17,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"This complaint involves Citibank regarding the misapplication of payments and incorrect late reporting on my account. This is a recurring issue, as I previously submitted complaint # XXXX regarding similar concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I agreed to a repayment plan with Citibank. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I made two payments ( {$180.00} and {$92.00} ), which I understood would bring my account current for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX based on information provided by a Citibank representative. Despite this, Citibank continues to report my account as late. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a representative ( ID : XXXX ) who stated that because I did not make an additional payment in XXXX, my account is considered past due. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX XXXX who indicated the account is not past due but the XXXX payment was not received. Even thought a payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX I would still need to make the payment that is due XX/XX/XXXX in spite the fact of XXXX confirming the account is current based on the repayment program. 

This contradicts the {$0.00} past due balance shown in my online Citibank account. Of which I have attached supporting evidence. Citibanks own correspondence states that payments can be made on or before the XXXX of the month. My XX/XX/XXXX, payment should have covered XX/XX/XXXX, as it was made within the allowable timeframe. Citibank appears to be applying payments strictly by chronological month rather than honoring their stated policy of allowing early payments. 

This situation has caused unnecessary damage to my credit report and financial standing, despite my adherence to the agreed-upon repayment plan. I request an immediate review of this issue and a formal response from Citibank through the CFPBs complaint resolution process.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,754XX,,Consent provided,Web,2025-03-17,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,12526326

I requested validation of the debt per my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), but the creditor/collection agency failed to provide sufficient documentation. 

The reported balance and payment history contain inaccuracies that I have disputed with the credit bureaus, yet the creditor refuses to correct or remove the erroneous data. 

The account was sold to a third-party collector, yet it remains listed under the original creditor, creating duplicate reporting and unfair harm to my credit profile.

2025-02-27,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I am submitting this formal complaint against Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian for their repeated, systemic violations of my consumer rights. These credit reporting agencies have reported fraudulent accounts, unauthorized inquiries, and gross inaccuraciesincluding inconsistent open dates, mismatched account numbers, and contradictory payment historiesacross my credit file. Despite my dispute letters dated XX/XX/year>, none of the agencies have taken appropriate corrective action. I now seek immediate CFPB intervention to compel these agencies to expunge these fraudulent entries and to enforce robust compliance with every applicable law and industry standard, including Metro 2 reporting guidelines.

I. Background and Overview Without my knowledge or consent, the following four accounts have been reported on my credit file. Not only do they contain significant discrepancies, but they also flagrantly violate multiple provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other consumer protection statutes : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Issues : Charged-off status ; inconsistent reporting of open dates and payment statuses across bureaus ; failure to provide required debt validation and notification. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Issues : Collection account with varying open dates and balance discrepancies ; improper handling of dispute and validation protocols. 
XXXX XXXX ( Entry One High Credit Amount Discrepancies ) Account Number : XXXX Issues : Reported with conflicting high credit limits and open dates that differ across credit reports, demonstrating an inability to maintain data accuracy. 
XXXX XXXX ( Entry Two Monthly Payment Discrepancies ) Account Number : XXXX Issues : Duplicate entry with monthly payment inconsistencies and differing open dates, further evidencing a breach of standard reporting practices. 
In addition, unauthorized credit inquiries from various entities ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX further compound these violations. 

Enclosed Exhibits 25 provide supporting evidence of these discrepancies and errors.

II. Detailed Account Discrepancies and Additional Violations Inconsistencies in Open Dates and Account Numbers : The reported open dates for the XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX accounts vary significantly between Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Such discrepancies not only violate the FCRAs mandate for maximum accuracy ( FCRA 607 ( b ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) but also contravene Metro 2 compliance guidelines, which require uniformity and standardization in data reporting. 
The XXXX XXXX account appears twice with the same truncated account number ( XXXX ) but conflicting details regarding monthly payments and open dates. This dual reporting creates confusion and directly impacts my creditworthiness. 
Failure to Validate and Notify : Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g, creditors are required to send written notification of debt validation within five days. None of the disputed accounts were validated according to this statutory requirement.

The credit bureaus have not conducted proper investigations as mandated by FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and have failed to reinvestigate disputes per FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ).

Data Inaccuracy and Metro 2 Noncompliance : The credit reporting agencies have failed to adhere to Metro 2 format standardsguidelines designed by the Consumer Data Industry Association for uniform data reportingwhich is evidenced by the significant discrepancies in account open dates, account numbers, and payment histories.

2025-04-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Hello. For years I have been fighting with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX about late payments over several accounts. For years they have promised to fix it, and for years they have failed to do so. 

I understand that going back years and giving details about every single time I have spoken to them is impractical. Suffice it to say that XXXX XXXX and I have been doing this dance for numerous years. I can prove this to you by providing a couple of letters I have received from XXXX XXXX stating they would remove late payments, but they never do. Please understand that I have received numerous of these letters for multiple accounts, but I will provide you with only XXXX to show that it has been going on for years with XXXX XXXX admitting to making mistakes and never fixing them. 

I guess to say they never do would be unfair. They partially remove late payments, but never completely. What I mean by that is that when I view my credit report, I see late payments that are removed from XXXX bureau, but not the other XXXX, or for another account I will see the late payment removed from XXXX bureaus, but not the third. 

This has been going on so many times over so many years across so many accounts that at this point it is nothing but incompetence or negligence on XXXX XXXX 's part. To be specific, XXXX XXXX has admitted many times to me by phone and in writing that their claim my payments were not on time were errors on their behalf. That's why they have given me letters many different times. The problem is that it keeps happening over and over. No matter how many times they catch their mistake, they keep misreporting that I pay late when I don't. 

I have spent numerous hours with them over the years about this situation that I am totally fed up. I have disputed these late payments with the credit bureaus for years only to once again have partial corrections made and not complete corrections or late payment removals. This has been affecting me for so many years that this is the last straw for me. If this complaint does not get XXXX XXXX or the credit bureaus to remove the late payments from all the accounts I have with XXXX XXXX at once, I am going to simply sue XXXX XXXX and possibly even the credit bureaus. 

I want the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  as well as the XXXX XXXX auto loan to have all late payments removed at once or I will file this with small claims and also with the XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,CA,932XX,,Consent provided,Web,2025-04-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12850132

This inaccurate reporting has negatively affected my credit profile, and I am requesting an immediate investigation into this matter. 
Details of the Disputed Late Payment : Creditor Name : XXXX / XXXX Account Number : # XXXX Date of Alleged Late Payment : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( experian and XXXX XXXX I firmly believe this late payment is incorrect. Additionally, I am providing the following supporting evidence : Legal Basis for Dispute : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S. Code 1681i I am exercising my right under this section to dispute inaccurate information reported on my credit file. The reported late payment does not accurately reflect my payment history, and I am requesting a formal investigation and correction.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S. Code 1637 ( b ) Creditors must provide clear and accurate billing statements to consumers. If this late payment reporting does not align with the terms of my agreement, it constitutes an error that should be rectified immediately. 
Obligations of Information Furnishers - 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 Creditors and furnishers must ensure that the information reported to credit bureaus is accurate. If the creditor can not substantiate the late payment with verifiable documentation, they must remove it from my credit file.

Requested Action : Conduct a thorough investigation into this dispute and provide a written response within 30 days as required by law.

If the late payment can not be verified, instruct the creditor to update my account status to "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late. '' Notify the credit reporting agencies ( Experian, XXXX, and XXXX ) to reflect the corrected information on my credit report. 
Reference to PAANL ( Paid As Agreed Never Late ) : The terms of our agreement have always been adhered to, and the account in question should reflect a status of "" Paid As Agreed Never Late '' based on the timely payments made. It is imperative that my credit report accurately represents my financial responsibility and commitment to meeting payment obligations. 

I hereby request that you provide documented proof supporting the claim of late payments on this account. This proof should include specific details such as dates, amounts, and any relevant communication indicating that the payments were indeed late. In the absence of valid proof, I expect the credit reporting to be rectified promptly. 

If, after a thorough investigation, you are unable to provide verifiable proof of late payments, I demand that the account be promptly updated to reflect its accurate status as "" Paid As Agreed Never Late. '' Per the FCRA, I request that you conduct a timely investigation and provide a written response within 30 days from the receipt of this dispute letter. 

Failure to adhere to this timeline will be considered a violation of the FCRA. Appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and expect a resolution that aligns with the legal obligations outlined by the FCRA. Your cooperation is crucial in maintaining the accuracy and fairness of my credit report. 
Failure to properly investigate and correct this inaccurate information will result in further actions, including a potential escalation to legal authorities for non-compliance with federal consumer protection laws. 
I have enclosed copies of all supporting documents related to this dispute. Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and provide a written update on the investigation 's progress within the legally mandated timeframe. 
Thank you for your time and immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system.

After I conducted further investigation with my insurance ( XXXX ) I found out my therapist was billing incorrectly using the wrong code, including this cancellation fee. I was in conversation with XXXX  trying to sort this out and on XX/XX/XXXX I received written email communication from them apologizing for their errors stating that it had been resolved. Later on XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX at Collection Solutions Inc stating that this fee had been sent to a debt collector without my knowledge and after I had received written communication from XXXX  that it had been resolved. I reached out to XXXX  multiple times to get this fixed and work it out and they were dismissive. I provided them with evidence, including screenshots of text conversations proving that I did not cancel my appointment and was simply running late. When I notified my therapist she said it was fine and was willing to accommodate me, we were even making plans to meet later in the day as that is what she preferred. Moreover, I sent them several screenshots of her cancelling our appointments on me day of because of her own personal matters. Every time I was understanding and willing to reschedule. In spite of all this evidence, they refused to do the right thing and listen to me. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX billing called me to yell at me and tell me she was not going to do anything about it.

Recently, my account was compromised by individuals posing as XXXX  support representatives. Upon discovering unauthorized transactions and missing funds, I immediately reported the incident to XXXX. Instead of receiving assistance as a victim of fraud, I find myself being penalized with account closure and an extended hold on my funds. 

I want to bring to your attention several critical points : The fraud occurred due to sophisticated impersonation of XXXX  support staff, highlighting a security vulnerability in the system rather than any violation on my part. 

The funds currently held in my account ( {$470.00} ) were legitimately obtained through the sale of XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. 

Most crucially, these funds are urgently needed to purchase an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) device for my XXXX XXXX  who has XXXX XXXX.

I understand XXXX XXXX  commitment to maintaining platform security and preventing fraudulent activities. However, in this case, I am the victim of fraud, not the perpetrator. The extended hold on my funds creates an undue hardship, particularly given my daughter 's pressing medical needs. 

I can provide the following documentation to support my appeal : Complete transaction history showing my legitimate use of XXXX XXXX documentation regarding my daughter 's condition and the necessity of an XXXX device All correspondence with XXXX  support regarding the unauthorized access.
