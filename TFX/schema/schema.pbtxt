That\'s why they have given me letters many different times. The problem is that it keeps happening over and over.

My XX/XX/XXXX, payment should have covered XX/XX/XXXX, as it was made within the allowable timeframe. Citibank appears to be applying payments strictly by chronological month rather than honoring their stated policy of allowing early payments. \n\nThis situation has caused unnecessary damage to my credit report and financial standing, despite my adherence to the agreed-upon repayment plan.
